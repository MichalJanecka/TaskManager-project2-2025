# Enhanced task manager project (2025)
The repository for the Task manager (Project 2) of Testing Academy course (ENGETO)

---

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository showcasing the outcome of a three-month online course (April–July 2025) focused on software testing ([ENGETO - Testing Academy](https://engeto.cz/testovani-softwaru/)). This repository contains the second project from the course: a Python-based task manager (in Czech) developed in VS Code, which performs CRUD operations using a MySQL database instead of storing tasks in memory.
